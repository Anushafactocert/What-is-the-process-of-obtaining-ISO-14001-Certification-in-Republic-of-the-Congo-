**What is an EMS?**

An Environmental Management System (EMS) is a set of processes designed by corporations to help in the cost-effective fulfilment of environmental goals. An EMS is an organizational structure designed to meet regulatory requirements.

Analyzing the environmental impacts and regulatory requirements of the company;

Examining the Organization’s environmental goals;

Setting environmental objectives and targets to reduce environmental impacts while meeting regulatory requirements;

Developing programs to meet these aims and objectives;

Monitoring and evaluating progress toward objectives;

Ensuring environmental knowledge and proficiency among workers and monitoring and enhancing the EMS’s effectiveness

**What are the Advantages of ISO 14001 Certification?**

**How does one acquire ISO 14001 Certification in Republic of the Congo?**

While the ISO 14000 Certification process in Republic of the Congo differs based on the industrial sector, firm size, number of sites, and available resources, the following is a general overview:

**Evaluation by the Certifying Body:**

Because the process might take only three to 2 years, independent certification auditors usually start with an examination. The initial assessment examines an organization’s present environmental management system, finds possibilities for improvement and prepares for the ISO 14000 Certification audit.

**Organizational Documentation Is Necessary:**

In other cases, such as when a cross-functional team with appropriate expertise manages certification issues internally, preparing the required document may be more accessible. In addition to declaring the scope, environmental policy, objectives, and plans, the company must provide documentation of its communication, risk-based planning, and operational control systems, among other documents.

**The Certifying Body will undertake the following audit:**

After obtaining the relevant documentation from the certifying body, they usually inform the Organization of the date of their onsite visit. It is the process through which external auditors determine whether the information in reports is implemented. Certification auditors should conduct interviews with people and confirm that all written material adheres to ISO 14000 requirements.

**Resolution of Organizational Nonconformity:**

During the third-party certification audit, nonconformity is often identified. There are two categories of variance: minor and substantial. Minor nonconformities, such as inconsistent maintenance records and out-of-date processes, must be addressed within 60 days.

Non-compliance with any ISO 14001:2015 regulation, a lack of relevant documentation of corrective efforts, and missing procedures may result in repeated certification.

**Organizational Certifying Body Certification:**

Once the Organization is certified with ISO 14001 Certification in Republic of the Congo, It is valid for three years once corrective actions with adequate documentation are performed and the certifying authority determines that the Organization meets ISO 14000 standards.

External Audits are conducted yearly to certify certification and show commitment to continuous improvement.
